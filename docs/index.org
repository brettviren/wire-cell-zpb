This package provides the ~WireCellZpb~ plugin library to the Wire-Cell
Toolkit.  It gives a mechanism to extract or inject data between an
executing WCT graph and external entities.  The transport is provided
using [[https://github.com/brettviren/zio][ZIO]] (functionality on top of ZeroMQ technologies) and the data
WCT is serialized as protobuf objects.
