#+title: Wire-Cell Toolkit ZeroMQ/protobuf interface to ZIO

This package provides the ~WireCellZpb~ plugin library to the Wire-Cell
Toolkit.  It gives a mechanism to extract or inject data between an
executing WCT graph and external entities.  The transport is provided
using [[https://github.com/brettviren/zio][ZIO]] (functionality on top of ZeroMQ technologies) and the data
WCT is serialized as protobuf objects.

See the [[file:docs/index.org][documentation]] directory for more
information or online at https://brettviren.github.io/wire-cell-zpb.
